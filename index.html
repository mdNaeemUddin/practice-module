            Welcome to the MDN learning area. This set of articles aims to guide complete beginners to web development
            with all that they need to start coding websites.

            The aim of this area of MDN is not to take you from "beginner" to "expert" but to take you from "beginner"
            to "comfortable." From there, you should be able to start making your way, learning from the rest of MDN,
            and other intermediate to advanced resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge.

            If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging — we will hold your hand and provide
            enough detail for you to feel comfortable and learn the topics properly. You should feel at home whether you
            are a student learning web development (on your own or as part of a class), a teacher looking for class
            materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how web technologies work.

        <h2>Where to start</h2>
        <p>
            If you are a complete beginner to web development, we'd recommend that you start by working through our <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web" target="_blank">Getting started with the web module</a>, which provides a practical introduction to web development.
        </p>
        <h2>Beyond the basics</h2>
        <p>
            If you have a bit of knowledge already, the next step is to learn <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS " target="_blank">CSS</a> in detail: start with our <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML" target="_blank">Introduction to HTML</a> module and move on to our <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps" target="_blank">CSS first steps</a> module.
        </p>
        <h2>Moving onto scripting</h2>
        <p>
            If you are comfortable with HTML and CSS already, or you are mainly interested in coding, you'll want to move on to JavaScript or server-side development. Begin with our JavaScript first steps and Server-side first steps modules.
        </p>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>
        <h2>Framworks and tooling</h2>
        <p>
            After mastering the essentials of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you should learn about client-side web development tools, and then consider digging into client-side JavaScript frameworks, and server-side website programming.
